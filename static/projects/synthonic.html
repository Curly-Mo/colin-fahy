	<h2>Description:</h2>
  <p>An audio additive synthesizer based on the concept of adjusting the ADSR (Attack Decay Sustain Release) envelope of each individual harmonic/partial, which should theoretically allow for the creation of any possible sound.</p>
	<h2>Features:</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Visuals show what the current sound looks like and how it changes over time in both the time domain and frequency domain.</li>
    <li>Works with any MIDI input device or the keyboard for playing notes.</li>
    <li>Apply frequency modulation and amplitude modulation to each individual partial.</li>
    <li>Add filtered noise (subtractive synthesis) for sounds that might not otherwise be possible without a very large number of sinusoids.</li>
    <li>Presets show how this synthesizer could be used to mimic real instruments such as a bell or clarinet.</li>
  </ul>
