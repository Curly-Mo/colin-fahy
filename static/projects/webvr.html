	<h2>Description:</h2>
  <p>A Virtual Reality interface for listening to 3-Dimensional audio. Inspired by the work I did with the original <a href="#projects/binauralplayground">binaural playground</a>, after I was dissapointed with the outcome of trying to represent 3D space in a 2D interface.</p>
	<h2>Features:</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Runs on Oculus Rift, GoogleCardboard/GearVR as well as in any browser without the VR effect.</li>
    <li>Upload the stems of a song to here each instrument as a separate moveable point source in 3D space.</li>
  </ul>
