	<h2>Description:</h2>
  <p>Crosstalk cancellation is process similar to headphone active noise cancellation used to cancel the sound travelling from a speaker to the listner's opposing ear. This can isolate the sound from stereo speakers such that each ear can only hear sound coming from one speaker without any crosstalk. This allows for binaural sound reproduction over stereo speakers, something that is usually only possible over headphone reproduction.<br>
  This is a Python implementation based on the Recursive Ambiophonic Crosstalk Elimination (RACE) algorithm.However, unlike the original algorithm this allows for customizing the speaker distance, listener distance, and listener head-size to optimize the delay and attenuation values for your specific speaker setup.</p>
