	<h2>Description:</h2>
  <p>My thesis for my M.M in Music Technology at NYU. It is a repurposing of audio fingerprinting to detect when an audio track has sampled directly from another audio track. It uses Scale Invariant Feature Transform (SIFT) features from the field of Computer Vision repurposed as keypoints of an audio spectrogram as an audio fingerprinting algorithm.<br>
  In addition to detecting whether a track has sampled from any of the tracks in the dataset, it can determine the amount of pitch shifting or timestretching that has been applied to the sample.<br>
