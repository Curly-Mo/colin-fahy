	<h2>Description:</h2>
  <p>The first full website I ever built. Shortly after college while I was still unemployed I grew frustrated with the available resources for finding jobs and decided to build the site that I wish existed. It is based off the popular website ratemyprofessors.com but for employers. Unlike the other job finding websites out there that seem to focus on profiting off their users rather than actually helping them, this site provides direct links to the company career pages to let you apply on your own terms.<br>
  Like any site that relies on user-generated content, it is useless if it doesn't have any users. I let the domain expire, but the content can still be found at: <a href="http://ratemyemployers.appspot.com" target="_blank">http://ratemyemployers.appspot.com</a></p>
