	<h2>Description:</h2>
  <p>Time2Go is a native Android App that syncs with your Google Calendar. Receive notifications when it is time to leave to make it to your events on time. Uses the location of events in your Google Calendar and the Google Directions API to estimate travel time.</p>
	<h2>Features:</h2>
  <p>Set travel mode as Driving, Biking, Walking, or Public Transit. Set the amount of time before it is time to go to receive the notification. Only sync certain calendars that are associated with your Google Account.
The app can parse your event titles and descriptions for the names of contacts and use that contacts address as the event location. Individual events can have a tag added (e.g. -driving) to specify the travel mode for that event only.</p>
	<h2>Legacy:</h2>
	<p>A year after the release of Time2Go, Google added very similar functionality into their app Google Now. Some users still preferred Time2Go since Google Now is a little less consistent, but I decided to stop maintaining Time2Go since I didn't think it was worth competing with Google. I can't guarantee that the app is still working with the latest version of Android.</p>
