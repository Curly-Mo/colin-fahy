  <p>
  I am a software developer with a passion for music.
  I studied Computer Science at UC Santa Cruz and Music Technology at NYU. <br>
  I have my M.M in Music Technology and work mainly with Music Informatics and 3D-Audio. My thesis was on <a href="#projects/samplingdetection">The Automatic Detection of Musical Sampling</a>.

  
  <br /><br />
  I consider myself a full-stack developer. I am constantly working on personal projects and web apps, though I would say my main focus is in backend and data science.
